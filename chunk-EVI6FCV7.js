My earliest memories with playing games are playing Super Mario Bros. 3 on the NES at home or playing Doom 2 at my dad's office. This never stopped and I continued on for the rest of my life playing games as my primary hobby and focus of attention. I was usually quite good at the various competitive games that I played, but there were always friends at school that were better than me. When I got to University, I started to become quite a bit better than others to the detriment of my studies. Starcraft 2, League of Legends, World of Warcraft, and Diablo 3 are the main games where I'd been able to reach a 95th (or more) percentile position on their respective competitive ladders.
